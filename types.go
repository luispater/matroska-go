// Package matroska defines all the data structures and constants used in the Matroska/EBML project.
//
// Matroska is an extensible open standard Audio/video container format. This package provides
// the core types and constants needed to parse, create, and manipulate Matroska files.
//
// The package includes definitions for:
//   - Compression types used in Matroska tracks
//   - Track types (video, audio, subtitle)
//   - Tag target types
//   - Seek types for navigation
//   - Packet flags for demuxed data
//   - Core data structures like Packet, TrackInfo, SegmentInfo, Attachment, Chapter, Cue, and Tag
//
// These types are used throughout the project to represent different aspects of Matroska files
// and serve as the central location for all data type definitions used by other files in the project.
